1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is an open-source library for software engineers to construct user interfaces. The main issue that is solved by react is the construction and augmentation of large applications that include temporal data changes.

1. Describe component state.

State is an "object" in react programming that refers to the sections of the app that you can manipulate. Each of these sections, or components, can possess their own "state". This is tied to the component with this.state.

1. Describe props.

"props" stands for properties. "props" is used in programming to pass data from one component to another. However, you must remember that props only passes data in a "uni-directional" flow, or from parent to child only.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Any piece of code that manages to affect other code, such as functions, but "outside" of the function's scope.
